# Testing the IDPS

To test the IDPS on the idps_test folder:

1. Ensure you have run the IDPS as described above.
2. In a separate terminal, run the following command from the idps_test directory:

    python test_idps_events.py

This script will:
- Create a new file in normal/
- Modify an existing file in normal/
- Move a file from suspicious/ to normal/
- Delete a file in normal/

You should see alerts and logs generated by the IDPS in response to these actions.
